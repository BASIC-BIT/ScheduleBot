# Discord Ticketing Bot Specification

## Overview
This specification outlines the requirements, architecture, data handling, error handling strategies, and testing plan for a Discord ticketing system integrated into an existing Discord bot built with C# and DSharpPlus. The system enables users to create various ticket types, interact via templated questions, manage ticket lifecycle, and provides robust logging and administrative controls.

---

## Functional Requirements

### Ticket Types and Templates

#### 1. Staff Application Ticket
- **Positions Available:** Community Manager, Host, Moderator, Discord Admin, Promoter, New Community Outreach
- **Questions:** (18 detailed questions provided by client)

#### 2. Guru/Teacher Application Ticket
- **Questions:** (5 detailed questions provided by client)

#### 3. Bot/Issue Report Ticket
- **Questions:** Issue description, Discord account name/User ID, screenshot proof

### Ticket Creation and Interaction
- Users initiate tickets via:
  - Dedicated Discord channel buttons
  - Slash commands (e.g., `/ticket staff-application`)
- Upon initiation:
  - Bot immediately creates a private Discord thread.
  - Bot posts predefined templated questions.
  - Users respond directly within the thread.

### Ticket Management
- Users and admins can close tickets directly within the thread.
- Optional reason prompt upon ticket closure.
- Admins can manually assign tickets to specific staff members or add any server member to a ticket.
- Closed tickets are removed from the active "Tickets List" channel and threads are closed.

### Notifications and Alerts
- Optional role-based notifications per ticket type (initially single role or none).
- Alerts triggered for tickets open longer than one week, recurring weekly thereafter, sent to a dedicated Discord channel.

### Logging and Historical Records
- All ticket interactions (content and metadata) stored in MySQL database.
- Closed tickets logged to a dedicated "Ticket Histories" Discord channel.
- No default retention period; configurable in future.

### Administrative Controls and Configuration
- Initial configuration via Discord commands.
- Future web-based admin panel preferred.
- Configuration adjustments restricted to specific maintainer roles.

---

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** C#
- **Discord Library:** DSharpPlus
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Current Hosting:** AWS ECS (Docker)
- **Future Hosting:** VPS with Docker, managed via Pterodactyl and Traefik
- **Deployment:** Continuous deployment workflows already established

### Discord Structure
- **Channels:**
  - Dedicated channel for ticket creation buttons.
  - "Tickets List" channel for active tickets overview.
  - "Ticket Histories" channel for closed ticket logs.
  - Dedicated channel for long-running ticket alerts.
- **Threads:**
  - Private threads per ticket, accessible only to ticket creator and defined staff roles.

## Data Handling and Database Schema

### Database: MySQL
- **Tables:**
  - `tickets`
    - `ticket_id` (Primary Key, Auto Increment)
    - `ticket_type` (VARCHAR)
    - `creator_user_id` (VARCHAR)
    - `creator_username` (VARCHAR)
    - `status` (ENUM: open, closed)
    - `assigned_staff_user_id` (VARCHAR, nullable)
    - `created_at` (DATETIME)
    - `closed_at` (DATETIME, nullable)
    - `closure_reason` (TEXT, nullable)
  - `ticket_messages`
    - `message_id` (Primary Key, Auto Increment)
    - `ticket_id` (Foreign Key)
    - `sender_user_id` (VARCHAR)
    - `sender_username` (VARCHAR)
    - `message_content` (TEXT)
    - `timestamp` (DATETIME)

### Data Security and Compliance
- No specific requirements provided; standard best practices recommended.

---

## Error Handling and Edge Cases

### Ticket Creation Limits
- Initially allow unlimited simultaneous tickets per user.
- Future configurable limits (single ticket, maximum number, unlimited).

### Unauthorized Access
- Users restricted from viewing unauthorized tickets; Discord permissions enforced strictly.

### Misuse and Unexpected Interactions
- Logging of misuse or unexpected interactions to a dedicated Discord channel.
- Potential future integration with external logging services.

---

## Testing Plan

### Unit Testing
- Test individual bot commands and methods for ticket creation, assignment, closure, and logging.
- Validate database interactions (CRUD operations).

### Integration Testing
- Test end-to-end ticket creation via buttons and slash commands.
- Verify thread creation, templated question posting, and user interactions.
- Confirm proper notifications and alerts.

### Edge Case Testing
- Attempt unauthorized access to tickets.
- Test handling of multiple simultaneous tickets per user.
- Validate logging of misuse or unexpected interactions.

### Performance Testing
- Given low concurrency (max ~20 active tickets, ~5 new tickets/day), basic performance testing sufficient.
- Monitor response times and database query performance.

### User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- Conduct UAT with a small group of staff members.
- Validate usability, clarity of interactions, and administrative controls.

---

## Deployment and Maintenance

### Deployment
- Dockerized deployment via existing AWS ECS setup.
- Future migration to VPS with Docker, managed via Pterodactyl and Traefik.
- Continuous deployment workflows already established; no additional setup required.

### Maintenance and Monitoring
- Monitor Discord bot uptime and responsiveness.
- Regularly review logs in "Ticket Histories" and misuse logging channels.
- Database backups recommended (standard MySQL backup practices).

---

## Documentation and Training

### Documentation
- Provide a clear, comprehensive README file covering:
  - Bot setup and deployment instructions.
  - Configuration commands and options.
  - Administrative controls and ticket management instructions.
  - Database schema and data handling details.

---

## Future Extensibility and Integrations

- Future integrations (analytics, logging, uptime monitoring) handled via existing MySQL database.
- Database schema designed for easy extensibility.

---

## Timeline and Priorities

### Initial Implementation (1-2 days of work)
- Functional first pass:
  - Ticket creation via buttons and slash commands.
  - Thread creation and templated questions.
  - Basic ticket closure and logging to database and Discord channels.

### Full Implementation (spread over a couple of weeks, light workload)
- Administrative controls (manual assignment, role-based notifications).
- Long-running ticket alerts.
- Configurable options via commands (future web-based admin panel).
- Robust error handling and logging.

---

## Conclusion
This specification provides a clear, detailed roadmap for immediate implementation. It outlines all necessary requirements, technical architecture, data handling, error handling strategies, and testing plans. The developer can confidently begin implementation based on this comprehensive document.
